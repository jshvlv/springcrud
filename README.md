###The app using the following technologies:


__- Java 8__

After starting the application, we can access the container through the local address 
(127.0.0.1).


Using simple HTTP requests and JSON we access the controller.


The __AccountController__ class is responsible for address mapping. (__CONTROLLER__)


Depending on the request the controller calls the corresponding __AccountService__ method. (__MODEL__)


You can use the __Postman__ utility to send the request (JSON). (__VIEW__)
